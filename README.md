##  Location-Based Attendance

- Integrated **HTML5 Geolocation API** to fetch student's latitude & longitude
- Used **Haversine formula** in PHP to calculate the distance between student and teacher
- Attendance allowed only if the student is within the specified range (e.g., 100 meters)
- Blocked attendance after multiple failed attempts from different devices or outside location

---

##  Course Material Sharing

- Teachers can upload files like notes, assignments, etc.
- Materials are associated with subject and division
- Only students of that specific division and subject can access/view/download materials
- Supports secure file upload with size/type validation

---

##  Security

- Passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` (Bcrypt)
- Role-based access control using PHP session checks
- File uploads validated for type and size to prevent abuse
- Session validation on every page using `redirectIfNotLoggedIn()` and `redirectIfNotRole()`
