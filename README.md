##  Location-Based Attendance

- Integrated **HTML5 Geolocation API** to fetch student's latitude & longitude

- Blocked attendance after multiple failed attempts from different devices or outside location

##  Course Material Sharing

- Teachers can upload files like notes, assignments, etc.
- Materials are associated with subject and division

##  Security

- Passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` (Bcrypt)
